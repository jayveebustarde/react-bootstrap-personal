Some vendors, limited in their digital capabilities, only provided inventory access through XML files from their Google Shopping feed. Simplifying and unifying these varied approaches was essential to realize Zipadoo's vision."

It wasn't just about showcasing products; it was vital that Zipadoo's inventory mirrored the actual stock availability from each vendor, regardless of their primary platform. Utilizing these APIs allowed for an agile approach to inventory management, ensuring that whether a customer was viewing a product from a major eCommerce system or a niche platform, the stock information was accurate, enhancing user trust and streamlining the purchase process."

To make sure everything on Zipadoo's platform looked uniform and made sense to our users, we had a straightforward approach. Vendors would upload a CSV file during product synchronization. This file was key; it contained the mapping – connecting the vendor's product categories to Zipadoo's categories. This simple step of uploading a CSV made a big difference. It meant that even though products came from various places, on Zipadoo, they all felt like they belonged to one organized, user-friendly platform."
